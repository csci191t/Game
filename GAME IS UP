Game is up, but the project is too large for github. Here is the link:

Hope you guys have a google account. Play the game a couple of times, there are only 2 available playable areas.
Tried my best to get it done, I'm pretty much over it to be honest. We will present it as is.

As for credit, study the code that you want credit for and you'll explain that part of the code on wednesday.
